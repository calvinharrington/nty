AutoChess Cheat Sheet/Quick Guide by Ex-Queen Current Bishop Pleb. Hi r/AutoChess, I wrote a cheat sheet for my QIHL friends as a quick overview for pivot options, available build path and choosing units/side synergies. A lot of beginners really liked it so I'd like to share it here and hope more people will find it helpful! Auto Chess is the original auto battler game co-developed by Dragonest Co., Ltd and Drodo Studio, and published by Dragonest Co., Ltd. Since the launch of Auto Chess, it has had significant influence all over the world with its brand new gameplay mode and strategic competitive features. History Help Close.
