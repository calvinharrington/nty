Learn everything you need to know about cheat meals, and how to implement them into your training. Similarly, find great cheat meal ideas. · If you're over 12%, you can cheat once every two weeks. Those above a certain fat threshold – say 16% bodyfat, or anyone with more than 40 pounds to lose – probably don't need to cheat from a physiological standpoint. These people are better off with cheat meals, not cheat days, which should be used once every two weeks until progress slows.  · There is no specific guideline for when or how frequently your cheat meal or day should occur. Often people will include one cheat per week, but this can change depending on what the person’s.
