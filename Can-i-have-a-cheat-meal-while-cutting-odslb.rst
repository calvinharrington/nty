Answer (1 of 3): Hi this is maithreyaa, you can have one cheat meal while cutting, but 😁 you should cheat your meal smartly in a healthy manner, But since the cutting phase strives to lose weight, lose fat and get lean, cheating smart may be ideal for optimal results.  · Is it OK to have a cheat day while cutting? The short answer is YES. As long as you stay in a calorie deficit for the week you can indulge in your favourite foods for a day and not feel guilty. That said, you do need to be careful about what kind of foods you eat and how often you do cheat days as they can derail your progress.
