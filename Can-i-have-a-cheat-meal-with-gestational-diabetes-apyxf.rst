Tonight I’m having a cheat meal. I’ve been so good and my numbers have all been beautiful. They want my 2 hour postprandial to be.  · Have a cheat “meal”. Don’t have a cheat “day”. Plan your cheat meal. Don’t indulge in high carb foods if not planned. Try and make your cheat meal as healthy as possible. Don’t starve yourself the entire day to balance your cheat meal. Find better swaps for your cheat meal. Don’t ignore your cravings.  · at PM. This is my 3rd time with GDM. With each I do occasionally have a cheat meal for a special occasion like a baby shower. I am very picky about which extra carbs I eat and don't indulge in things I really don't enjoy as much. I try to be careful and eat lots of protein and drink water.
