 · Hacked with Cheat Engine ^^Download link of cheat table (open with CheatEngine):?v=jEija3Ar2uQ.  · . #1. Hello guys, I am writing this post because I'm hacking chess titans, I already made a hack in which it's always my turn. However, I was trying to go beyond that and make a hack that all my pieces can move anywhere. I'm using cheat engine, and I have seen a few tutorials from Fleep. So what I managed to do so far: I found User Interaction Count: 5.  · So here we go: Download the Chess Titans installer file from the link above. Save the downloaded file to your computer. Double-click on the downloaded Chess Titans installer file. Now, a smart screen might appear and ask for a confirmation. Click “Yes” to confirm. Finally, follow the installation App Name: Chess Titans.
