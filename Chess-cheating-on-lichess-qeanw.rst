Let me make this clear: Lichess' 'anti-cheat algorithm' either doesn't exist or is extremely basic. I have reported players with + games and 15/0 win streaks, all of them perfect and with less ACPL than Carlsen. They never got detected. It is also stupidly easy to get into the top classical ladder.  · If somebody is saying he cheated that's no reason to close an account. But sometimes guys are never quitting their games or are losing/winning on purpose against somebody many times in a row Then Lichess sees that and is dming them and also after a while banning. I hope that helped. FS-Schach. Lichess detect cheating by using a strong chess engine. In most chess servers the games are observed by a strong chess engine like Stockfish, and it constantly evaluates if the percentage of moves made by the players are identical to its top choices. This is likely the cheating detection system implemented in lichess.
