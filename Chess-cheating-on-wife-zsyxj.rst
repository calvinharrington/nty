Dear chess community: I sincerely apologize for my actions of cheating on  I succumbed to the pressures of being lazy and arrogant on a website that fosters good sportsmanship and fair play. I admit my mistake and humbly asked to be reinstated to play chess on the best website in the world. Anonymous NM: Hi  staff. What counts as cheating on ? A lot of words get thrown around in talks about cheating, such as ‘outside assistance’ ‘tablebase’ and ‘engine,’ but what are the specific things that count as cheating on ? Well, it’s a bit different depending on whether you are playing Live or Daily chess! It's easy to envision chess played by hunched, nerdy introverts striving to compete for mental dominance and intellectual pride in an utterly non-physical sports arena. Maybe cheating would seem too "low" for such a crowd, or off-brand for chess in general, but in reality the dire competitiveness of professional chess drives players of all skill levels to do whatever it takes Estimated Reading Time: 3 mins.
