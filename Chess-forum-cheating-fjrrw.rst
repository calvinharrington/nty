Hello, You can consider the cheat detected a warning and appeal it if you wish, here:  Today I played against a or so in a rapid game. He was beating me up the whole game so I kinda got suspicious of him. I checked the game's analysis (he got accuracy) and his profile and I mean he is pretty much a cheater I think. However he's a long-time gold-member so would he get away with. Just throwing this out there. What percentage of your opponents do you think are cheating? I believe one third to one half of my games, my opponent has used an aid. Maybe not on every play, but certainly many plays. I look at the game analysis after each game and the games I suspect cheating, my opponent.
