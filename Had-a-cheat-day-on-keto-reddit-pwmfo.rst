Today I had a cheat day - What I learnt and what I ate I do OMAD every single day (normally on the keto diet) and sometimes I fast for some days straight. I had been thinking about having a 'cheat' day (if you can call it that) for some time now, meaning I wouldn't pay as much attention to my calorie intake and eating window. My first cheat day was a after 2weeks on Ketosis, I had a Large Double Cheeseburger meal from McDonald's (with Coke Zero). I didn't feel anything particularly different physically. In terms of mental burden, it was the feeling that I was cheating and worrying about how long it'd take me to get back into Ketosis. No, I do not cheat on the carbs. I have days ( times a month) where I eat a little more carbs then I should (g), but never so much that I get kicked out of ketosis. I do however cheat some days where I eat more fat then the Keto Calculator says, and where the carbs and fat are not the healthiest ones (like small bits of 70% chocolate).
