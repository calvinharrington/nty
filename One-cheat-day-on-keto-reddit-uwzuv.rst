Don't care if this is downvoted. I observe a "cheat day" one every week. I try to think of it as a shitty ckd carb up. It usually is one night. My tolerance is still low and I just turned I'm trying to figure out a way to fit both together. I enjoy beers so that's what I drink and if that turns into me drunkenly getting a sandwich or pizza w.e. Some people do have cheat days, some do it once a month or every few months. It all depends on you and if you feel like you can get back on the horse and not crave carbs afterwards. 3 level 1 justjess · 7y No. Don't cheat. You will knock yourself out of the ketogenic state and it will take a while to get back to it. After a cheat day you will gain water weight lb. Which will be super discouraging. The worse thing is that you will take days to get back to keto and this not be losing weight for these days. After you've been on keto for over a month then cheats days will affect you a bit less. And so it will take days to get back into ketosis.
