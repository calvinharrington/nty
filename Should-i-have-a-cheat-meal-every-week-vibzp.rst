 · There is no specific guideline for when or how frequently your cheat meal or day should occur. Often people will include one cheat per week, but this can change depending on what the person’s.  · Limit your cheat meals to per week. And remember that the physical/hormonal benefit of cheat meals becomes more important as you get leaner (~10% for guys). If you are at 22% bodyfat as a man, you do not need more than one cheat meal per week as a man. The mental benefits, however, always apply.
