 · There is no specific guideline for when or how frequently your cheat meal or day should occur. Often people will include one cheat per week, but this can change depending on what the person’s. Individuals following a strict diet who use the cheat meal strategy find that they are prone to overeating or binge eating during their cheat meal or cheat day. After restricting and controlling your diet all week, your cheat meal or cheat day seems like a free-for-all. Afterward, you’re left sluggish and overly full.  · One cheat day every days may work well for you. If, however, the cheating slows your progress or leads to adding body fat, you know the solution: Reduce the amount of cheating and/or the frequency. If a full cheat day is halting your fat loss, reduce it to two cheat meals that day and reassess your progress from there.
