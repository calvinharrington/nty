 · The ideal is do not cheat any meal. But if you couldn't, I think 1 or 2 cheat meal per week will not affect the final result. Hey guys, I am about 1 week into my cutting routine now and seeing some pretty good results already currently I am having 1x cheat meal per week on a Saturday early in the day, I do cardio x per week and weights. I have a strategy that has worked pretty well for me during my cut. Other posters are completely right, eat at a 3, calorie deficit for a week and then overeat for one day by 1, and you've sabotaged yourself. To avoid this, I pick a day like Sunday to have my cheat meal. Depends, but be aware of how much you're eating on the cheat meal. One day with + calories wont kill you, but + calories for the day will start to slow down your cut. 1.
