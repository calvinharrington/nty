 · UNO The Call of Yara DLC. Join the revolution in UNO® The Call of Yara, the latest UNO® DLC based upon the unique world of Yara. Play as a guerrillero from the Libertad revolutionary group taking a much-needed break at one of the guerrilla camps hidden in the tropical jungle of Yara, the jewel of the Caribbean. Watch g: uno uplay · cheat. Uplay in Lutris won't detect your Steam games because your Steam games are in your native directory structure, Uplay will only see what's in its own wineprefix. I suggest you read up on how wineprefixes work for future reference.  · i am not exactly sure about what Uplay points give and how but i am a lil worried with how U-play and the DRM will affect the ability to mod\cheat\use trainers. if the DRM or Uplay will attempt to constantly keep the player's stats in sync with the ubi servers in order to measure their achievements than it feels like editing or changing anything with UBISOFT .
